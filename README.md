# Cloud lab 1
Createad and account on Heroku Cloud and logged in. 

Then followed the instructions to install Heroku CLI tool, checked the versions and so on.

Then followed the tutorial on how to deploy the node-js-getting started project which resulted in having that example on the Heroku Cloud. After that I modified the example project and added a endpoint that displays my name. 

There are the steps that I took in order to complete the lab.
